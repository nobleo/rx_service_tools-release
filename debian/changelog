ros-melodic-rx-service-tools (1.0.1-1bionic) bionic; urgency=high

  * Roslaunch compatible by allowing unkown arguments (#1 <https://github.com/nobleo/rx_service_tools/issues/1>)
    Only parse known arguments as roslaunch tends to add arguments like __name:= and __log:=
  * feat: Interactive service server GUI
    Based on the actionlib/axserver.py. Works exactly the same but for
    services instead of actions.
  * Contributors: Felix Widmaier, Tim Clephas
